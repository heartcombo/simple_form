  Be sure to have a copy of the Bootstrap 3 stylesheet available on your
  application, you can get it on http://getbootstrap.com/.

  Inside your views, use the 'simple_form_for' with one of the Bootstrap form
  classes, '.form-horizontal' or '.form-inline', as the following:

    = simple_form_for(@user, html: { class: 'form-horizontal' }) do |form|

  Bootstrap 4: In case you just noticed that you needed Bootstrap 4 Alpha,
  run 'generate simple_form:install --bootstrap4 --force' to get it.
