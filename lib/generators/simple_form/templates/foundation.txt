Be sure to have a copy of Zurb Foundation available on your
application, you can get it on http://foundation.zurb.com/ or
gem install "zurb-foundation"

We default to the "nice" forms. To change to normal minimalistic zurb,
remove the "nice" from config/initializers/simple_form.rb

	= simple_form_for(@user) do |form|
